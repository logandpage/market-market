            <h2>Search Engine Optimization</h2>
            <p>
                The dominance of mobile internet use means that users are searching for the right business as they travel, shop, or sit on their couch at home. Search Engine Optimization (SEO) allows you to increase your visibility and find the right customers for your business.

            <h2>Online Reputation Management</h2>
            <p>
                The web is full of opinions, and some of these can be negative. Social media allows anyone with an internet connection to say whatever they want about your business. Online Reputation Management gives you the control over what potential customers see when they search for your business.

            <h2>Social Media Marketing</h2>
            <p>
                Social media continues to have a sizable influence on buying habits. Social media marketing helps you determine which platforms are suited to your brand, using analytics to find the right markets and increase your lead generation.

        <h3>Solutions</h3>
        <h2>Ad Blocking Problems</h2>
        <p>
            Let me start by saying that our standard setup is pretty clean: No alcohol,
tobacco, games, politics. However, we do have the ability to further filter
content to meet the expectations of each publisher and we will be glad to make
sure to block your requests, where available. But, due to the nature of
programmatic ads, not every provider has the capabilities to block by brand,
but where it is possible, we will happily take care of it for you.
Please be aware that blocking major companies or categories like this can
have repercussions on ad revenue. If performance does decrease, keep in
mind that may be why. You'll also need to understand that even when we
set rules and filters accordingly - that some advertisers elect to not 'play by
the rules' and will mis-categorize an ad to gain more exposure. 
When we encounter this, we always try
our best to track down the culprit and disable them, but it can take a little
while to find them throughout all the exchanges and sometimes we just
aren't able to track down the offenders. We only ask that in those situations
you remember to be patient with us, this industry is far from perfect and we
have to work around its shortcomings.
        </p>
        <h2>Redirection to Spam Sites</h2>
        <p>
            These are absolutely not intentional, and we are doing everything 
we can eliminate them from the ad industry. This is a blog post we wrote 
about the issue a little while ago, giving some more background information on 
the issue and what we are doing to fix it:
https://www.monumetric.com/2016/09/02/redirects-101/
Right now, our Ad-Ops team make some adjustments to things on
our end and run some tracking scans to see if we can figure out if a specific
provider is serving these or whatnot. Any information you can give us about
them is helpful: browser you were using, the device you were on, time and
location when it happened, etc.--this can help us track them down because,
without that, they are virtually impossible to find since they are disguised as
regular ads.
Please let us know if you see another one, and we will let you know as we
make some changes on our end as well.

        <h2>History of RPM</h2>
        <p>
            The market trends in the advertising industry vary throughout the year. To
help prepare you for what the rest of the year holds, here's a brief
description of each of the year's quarters:
Q1 (Jan-Mar): This quarter starts off with the slowest performance rates of
the year. January comes right after Q4 when all of the major brands have
spent their budgets on the holidays and know that customers have spent
most of their flexible income. This leaves them with little incentive so they
pay less or buy less advertising during the first quarter. Performance slowly
increases throughout the quarter until March because people are inside
most of the day and browsing the internet (obviously this may vary based on
your niche audience and what they are looking for).
Q2 (Apr-Jun): Quarter two follows beginning quarter lows but quickly climbs
to perform around the yearly average until the summer months approach.
Part of this is due to more people heading on vacation and spending more of
their free time outside, not online.
Q3 (Jul-Sep): Traffic and earnings remain low but can spike around holidays
and improve sharply as back-to-school campaigns begin. As people return
from vacation and start the regular “school session” period along with cooler
weather, more individuals remain inside and begin spending more time
online again.
Q4 (Oct-Dec): This is almost always the best performing quarter of the year.
Performance starts around yearly averages near the beginning of the quarter
but steadily climbs through December. The last week of December usually
sags, as ad providers have exhausted their budgets and take an
industry-wide holiday.

        <h2>Your Ads vs.Your User's Ads</h2>
        <p>
            We partner with ad providers to give them access to top quality sites, 
like yours. In short, we at DigiMax do not choose or provide the actual ads you or 
your traffic see. These impressions are generated by the ad companies that win the 
bids for the different ad placements on your site and in turn, the actual ad image is
selected based on the individuals viewing, search and even shopping history.
This is why the actual ads you see when bringing up your site are not
identical to the ones your members may see. The placement and such are the
same but the actual ad image may not.
We hope that makes sense and helps clarify your questions about ads you may
or may not be seeing.
